# bls-hsm

## Design :page_with_curl:
Both projects emulate the behaviour of a command API that internally uses [blst library](https://github.com/supranational/blst#blst). They have been implemented with Segger Embedded Studio for the execution in Nordic Semiconductor nRF9160 board.


## Installation
In order to build the project, it's recommended to use nRF Connect SDK as it is explained in this [guide](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/gs_assistant.html).

## Usage
The commands that are supported are:
- *keygen*: generates a 32-bytes secret key and a 48-bytes public key randomly.
- *publickey*: shows the last public key that has been generated.
- *signature "publickey" "message"*: produces a 96-bytes signature with the message that has been introduced and after choosing a public key that has had to be generated before.
- *verify*: signature verification.
- *getkeys*: returns the public keys that have been generated.
- *benchmark*: runs the code from the key generation to the signature and it outputs the time needed to perform each operation.


## Implementations :pick:
**1. shell_module**: This project uses blst static library that has been compiled for Cortex-M33 architecture with the following command:
```
./build.sh CC=/some/where/toolchain/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10-2020-q4-major/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc-10.2.1 -mcpu=cortex-m33 flavour=elf -fno-pie
```

**2. shell_module_basic**: This project uses source files from blst library. They can be found in *src* folder and they have not been modified expect [line 70 in vect.h file](https://github.com/supranational/blst/blob/master/src/vect.h#L370) which has been commented in order to avoid errors during compilation.


PS. The *prj.conf* file has been modified in both projects because default size caused stack overflow from the UART thread. Current size is 49152 bytes.

**3. secure_module**: This module contains blst function calls that involve usage and storage of secret keys, using Secure Partition Manager (SPM).

## To Do: :ballot_box_with_check:
- [x] Benchmark command.
- [ ] Shell script for setting up the work environment.
- [ ] Include Nordic Security Backend in order to take advantage of the 144-byte random number used for the 32-byte vector in secret key generation function.
- [x] Execution of the code in ARM TrustZone.
