# bls-hsm

## Design :page_with_curl:
The project emulate the behaviour of a command API that internally uses [blst library](https://github.com/supranational/blst#blst). They have been implemented with Segger Embedded Studio for the execution in Nordic Semiconductor nRF9160 board.


## Installation
In order to build the project, it's recommended to use nRF Connect SDK as it is explained in this [guide](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/gs_assistant.html).

This project uses blst static library that can be compiled for Cortex-M33 architecture with the following command:
```
./build.sh CC=/some/where/toolchain/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10-2020-q4-major/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc-10.2.1 -mcpu=cortex-m33 flavour=elf -fno-pie
```
The shell script to configure the work environment is in progress. Meanwhile, you need to manually run the command, create "include" and "lib" folders, and include the binary library inside.


## Usage
The commands that are supported are:
- *keygen*: generates a 32-bytes secret key and a 48-bytes public key randomly.
  ```
  uart:~$ keygen
  Public key:
  0xa2c0acfbfc35763cf0ca221f2f44a42b3767dc168d00a99f3952ac5ad05cc25f4d8069a79b002ae665b9ad35ce800a0e
  ```
- *publickey*: shows the last public key that has been generated.
  ```
  uart:~$ publickey
   Public key:
   0xa2c0acfbfc35763cf0ca221f2f44a42b3767dc168d00a99f3952ac5ad05cc25f4d8069a79b002ae665b9ad35ce800a0e
  ```
- *signature "publickey" "message"*: produces a 96-bytes signature with the message that has been introduced and after choosing a public key that has had to be generated before.
  ```
  uart:~$ signature 0xa2c0acfbfc35763cf0ca221f2f44a42b3767dc168d00a99f3952ac5ad05c
  c25f4d8069a79b002ae665b9ad35ce800a0e 5656565656565656565656565656565656565656565
  656565656565656565656
  Signature:
  0xa60e2f24827943379f8377d6bf7a126ef8def56b08ca4cdd958954b5f56091f7cd49d251481f4cd6316396a2a4f4398c09e2cfda6ea16416dffdac687cf06db0e4d3a0ec83b4016c835b27f84325342199f724abd092cb7957177f5f30dcbe19
  ```
- *verify "public_key" "message" "signature"*: signature verification.
  ```
  uart:~$ verify 0x8077842bcf8d16d842d3b9b09ad78f717468577ddb189c02ded347d551aad50

  565656565656565656 0x8cea6d7e2e07efd6b6e56c2dabd04ec07dead82b5806e63b85945d1d75a

  d2be94cd64bb25426238ec85bf4767d892fea09825c07414421ec
  Success
  ```
- *getkeys*: returns the public keys that have been generated.
  ```
  uart:~$ getkeys
  {'keys':['a2c0acfbfc35763cf0ca221f2f44a42b3767dc168d00a99f3952ac5ad05cc25f4d8069a79b002ae665b9ad35ce800a0e']}
  ```


## Implementations :pick:
**1. cli**: This project uses blst static library that has been compiled for Cortex-M33 architecture with the following command:
```
./build.sh CC=/some/where/toolchain/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10-2020-q4-major/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc-10.2.1 -mcpu=cortex-m33 flavour=elf -fno-pie
```

PS. The *prj.conf* file has been modified because default size caused stack overflow from the UART thread. Current size is 49152 bytes.

**2. secure_module**: This module contains blst function calls that involve usage and storage of secret keys, using Secure Partition Manager (SPM).

## Test
"test" folder contains a test coded in [Go](https://golang.org/) language. In order to run it, you must install Go and run `go run .\main.go .\utils.go COMport [-v]` command in a terminal or `go build` and then `test.exe [-v] COMport`. Optional argument `-v` will show a detailed output of the tests. `COMport` is the board's serial port name.
This test will do the following:
- Generate 10 keypairs (the maximum allowed by the board) and check that all keys are different.
- Attempt to generate an extra key pair and confirm the board refuses to do that.
- Perform a signature of a message with the wrong size an confirm the board refuses to do that.
- Perform a signature of a message with the right size and check that the signature is properly verified.

## To Do: :ballot_box_with_check:
- [x] Benchmark command.
- [ ] Shell script for setting up the work environment.
- [x] Include Nordic Security Backend in order to take advantage of the 144-byte random number used for the 32-byte vector in secret key generation function.
- [x] Execution of the code in ARM TrustZone.
